                        If you’ve been banned from Flirtigo, you’ll see a message letting you know when you try to log in. 
                        We ban accounts when we detect account activity that violates our code of conduct. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        User safety is always at top of mind, and we don’t take violations of our policies lightly. 
                    </p>

                <p>
                    Your name and age are the only pieces of your profile you can't update once you've created an account.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you need to update one or both, you can delete your account and start over.
